# Java Design Principles and Patterns

## Design Principles
1. [Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPrinciples/Single%20Responsibility%20Principle): A class should have only one reason to change 
2. [Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPrinciples/Open%20Close%20Principle): Software entities like classes, modules and functions should be open for extension but closed for modifications. 
3. [Liskov's Substitution Principle](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPrinciples/Liskov's%20Substitution%20Principle): Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types 
4. [Interface Segregration Principle](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPrinciples/Interface%20Segregation%20Principle): Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they don't use.
5. [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPrinciples/Dependency%20Inversion%20Principle): High Level modules should not depend on low-level modules

## Design Patterns
1. [Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/samyak2405/Java-Design-Principles-and-Patterns/tree/main/DesignPatterns/CreationalPatterns): Simplifies the creation of object in Object oriented system.
