# Singleton Implementation for ConfigurationManagement

- Singleton pattern is used in Java to manage a configuration manager for a web application.

## Explanation

### Eager Initialization Prevention:
- The instance is created using double-checked locking in the getInstance method, ensuring lazy initialization.

### Serialization Prevention:
- The class implements Serializable, but the readResolve method is overridden to return the existing instance during deserialization, preventing the creation of a new instance.

### Reflection Prevention:
- The private constructor checks if an instance already exists, throwing an exception if an attempt is made to create a new instance using reflection.

### Other Drawbacks:
- The volatile keyword is used to address the double-checked locking anti-pattern and ensure that the instance is correctly initialized and visible to all threads in a multithreaded environment.
- The use of volatile ensures that any write to the instance variable is visible to all threads, and the double-checked locking pattern (checking instance for null before entering the synchronized block and checking it again inside the synchronized block) ensures that only one thread will create the instance while others wait.
- The private constructor checks for an existing instance to prevent multiple instances during eager or reflective instantiation.
